## Dev Notes

### Azure Resource Naming Convention
[Source: architecture/infrastructure.md]
- Resource Group: `afl-predictor-rg`
- App Service Plan: `afl-predictor-asp-{env}`
- App Service: `afl-predictor-{service}-{env}`
- Database: `afl-predictor-db-{env}`
- Redis: `afl-predictor-cache-{env}`
- Key Vault: `afl-predictor-vault-{env}`
- Application Insights: `afl-predictor-insights-{env}`

Where `{env}` = dev, staging, or prod

### Required Secrets in Key Vault
```
DATABASE_URL
REDIS_URL
JWT_ACCESS_SECRET
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET
SQUIGGLE_API_KEY
AFL_TABLES_API_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL (per environment)
```

### Deployment Strategy
- **Development**: Continuous deployment on push to `develop` branch
- **Staging**: Auto-deploy with manual approval gate
- **Production**: Manual approval required, blue-green deployment

### Cost Optimization Tips
1. Use Basic tier for development resources
2. Configure auto-scaling to handle load efficiently
3. Use reserved instances for production (1-year commitment saves ~40%)
4. Implement proper caching to reduce database load
5. Use Application Gateway for multiple services
6. Consider Azure Container Instances for microservices

### Security Checklist
- [ ] All services use HTTPS only
- [ ] Database connections use SSL
- [ ] Secrets stored in Key Vault, never in code
- [ ] Network Security Groups configured
- [ ] Azure AD authentication for admin access
- [ ] Regular security scans scheduled
- [ ] Backup encryption enabled

### Monitoring Requirements
- Application performance (response times, throughput)
- Infrastructure metrics (CPU, memory, disk)
- Custom business metrics (predictions made, formulas created)
- Error rates and exceptions
- Security events and anomalies

## Testing Requirements

### Deployment Testing
- Deploy a simple change and verify it reaches production
- Test rollback from production to previous version
- Verify health checks during deployment
- Test database migration in staging

### Performance Testing
- Load test with expected user load (100 concurrent users)
- Stress test to find breaking point
- Verify auto-scaling triggers appropriately
- Test cache effectiveness

### Disaster Recovery Testing
- Test database backup restoration
- Test recovery from region failure (if multi-region)
- Verify monitoring alerts trigger correctly

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All Azure resources provisioned and accessible
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline successfully deploys to all environments
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Security scan shows no critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Documentation complete and reviewed
- [ ] Cost projection documented and approved
- [ ] Handover to operations team completed

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Azure costs exceed budget | HIGH | MEDIUM | Implement cost alerts, use Dev/Test subscriptions |
| Security misconfiguration | HIGH | LOW | Follow Azure security best practices, use templates |
| Deployment failures | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Implement comprehensive rollback procedures |
| Performance issues | MEDIUM | LOW | Load test before production, implement caching |

## Dependencies
- Azure subscription with appropriate permissions
- Budget approval for Azure resources
- Domain name for custom domains (optional)
- SSL certificates (or use Azure managed certificates)

## Estimated Effort
- **Setup**: 2-3 days for basic infrastructure
- **Pipeline**: 1-2 days for CI/CD configuration
- **Testing**: 1 day for verification
- **Documentation**: 1 day
- **Total**: 5-7 days
