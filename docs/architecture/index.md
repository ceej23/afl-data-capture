# AFL Data Capture Platform - Architecture Documentation

## Overview

The AFL Data Capture platform is a user-driven sports prediction system that democratizes formula building through visual interfaces. This architecture supports 10,000+ concurrent users, sub-100ms formula calculations, and integrates multiple real-time data sources while maintaining 99.9% availability during peak periods.

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Architecture Style
- **Microservices-based** backend with domain-driven boundaries
- **Event-driven** data pipeline for real-time updates
- **CQRS pattern** for formula calculations and predictions
- **Progressive Web App** frontend for cross-platform compatibility
- **Azure-native** cloud infrastructure for scalability
- **Redis-backed** multi-layer caching strategy

### Design Principles
1. **User Experience First** - Every architectural decision considers UX impact
2. **Performance by Design** - Sub-100ms response times for critical operations
3. **Scalability Built-in** - Horizontal scaling for 10,000+ concurrent users
4. **Security in Depth** - Multiple security layers at every level
5. **Cost Optimization** - Stay within $500/month budget through smart resource usage
6. **AI-Friendly** - Clear patterns and structures for AI agent implementation
