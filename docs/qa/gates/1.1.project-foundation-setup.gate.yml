gate_decision: CONCERNS

completion_percentage: 70

summary: |
  The local development foundation is well-structured with proper monorepo setup,
  frontend/backend initialization, and CI pipeline. However, Azure infrastructure
  and deployment pipeline are not implemented, creating production readiness risk.

acceptance_criteria_status:
  passed:
    - "AC1: GitHub repository with README"
    - "AC2: Monorepo structure" 
    - "AC3: Next.js 14+ frontend"
    - "AC4: Fastify backend"
    - "AC5: Code quality tools"
    - "AC6: GitHub Actions CI"
    - "AC11: Environment examples"
    - "AC12: Local dev documentation"
  partial:
    - "AC9: PostgreSQL (Docker only)"
    - "AC10: Redis (Docker only)"
  failed:
    - "AC7: Azure DevOps CD"
    - "AC8: Azure environments"
    - "AC13: E2E deployment verification"

test_coverage:
  unit_tests: 0
  integration_tests: 0
  e2e_tests: 0
  test_infrastructure: "Configured but no tests written"

security_status:
  strengths:
    - "Sensitive files excluded from git"
    - "Environment variables abstracted"
    - "TypeScript strict mode"
    - "Trivy security scanning in CI"
  concerns:
    - "No rate limiting"
    - "CORS not configured"
    - "JWT secrets are placeholders"

technical_debt:
  high_priority:
    - "Azure infrastructure not created"
    - "Deployment pipeline missing"
  medium_priority:
    - "Zero test coverage"
    - "No test fixtures"
  low_priority:
    - "Backend README missing"
    - "No API documentation"

risks:
  - risk: "No Azure deployment capability"
    probability: HIGH
    impact: HIGH
    mitigation: "Complete Azure setup before next sprint"
  - risk: "Zero test coverage"
    probability: HIGH
    impact: MEDIUM
    mitigation: "Add tests in Story 1.2"
  - risk: "Missing monitoring"
    probability: MEDIUM
    impact: MEDIUM
    mitigation: "Add Application Insights with Azure"

conditions_for_pass:
  must_have:
    - "Provision Azure resources (manual acceptable)"
    - "Create deployment pipeline or document manual steps"
    - "Add at least one passing test"
    - "Document Azure configuration"
  nice_to_have:
    - "Terraform/IaC configuration"
    - "Automated deployments"
    - "Comprehensive test suite"

recommendations:
  blocking:
    - "Complete Azure infrastructure (AC 7, 8, 13)"
    - "Add minimal test to validate infrastructure"
  important:
    - "Add security middleware"
    - "Create test files for critical paths"
    - "Add backend README"
  future:
    - "Configure bundle analyzer"
    - "Setup Storybook"
    - "Add pre-push hooks"

advisory_note: |
  The team has built a solid foundation for local development with excellent
  code organization and tooling. Consider splitting Azure infrastructure into
  a separate story if needed to unblock progress. The current implementation
  provides good value for development team productivity.
