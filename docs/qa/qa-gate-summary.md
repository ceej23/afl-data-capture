## High Priority Issues

### Security Concerns
1. **Story 2.1**: API credential storage method should explicitly use Azure Key Vault
2. **Story 2.1**: Extended API outage handling needs manual fallback process

### Performance Concerns
1. **Story 1.3**: Search/filter operations need defined performance targets
2. **Story 1.4**: Maximum metric limits should be numerically specified

### Testing Gaps
1. **Story 1.4**: Keyboard navigation requires explicit test scenarios
2. **Story 1.3**: Virtual scrolling implementation needs clarification

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Before Sprint 1)
1. Define exact numeric limits for formula metrics (10 vs 15)
2. Specify Azure Key Vault usage for all secrets/credentials
3. Document manual data update process for API outages

### During Development
1. Add performance benchmarks for all search/filter operations
2. Create comprehensive keyboard navigation test suite
3. Implement spike for WASM performance validation

### Post-MVP Roadmap
1. Schedule MFA implementation timeline
2. Plan for secret rotation automation
3. Consider implementing data redundancy strategy

## Quality Metrics

- **Requirements Coverage**: 95% - All functional requirements mapped
- **Test Coverage Target**: 90%+ defined for critical paths
- **Security Posture**: Strong - JWT, rate limiting, HTTPS defined
- **Performance Targets**: Defined - <100ms calculations, <3s page loads
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance specified

## Conclusion

The project stories are **READY FOR DEVELOPMENT** with minor enhancements recommended. The identified concerns are non-blocking and can be addressed during implementation. The strong foundation of acceptance criteria and technical notes provides clear guidance for developers.
