# Requirements Gap Analysis & Technical Deep Dive

## Executive Summary

You're right to be concerned. Our implementation has significant gaps that indicate rushing into technical execution without proper planning. The branching strategy issue and 10+ deployment attempts are symptoms of deeper problems.

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Infrastructure & Architecture Misalignment ‚ö†Ô∏è

**PRD Requirements:**
- NFR7: Support 10,000 concurrent users
- NFR8: Azure hosting cost <$500/month
- Performance: <100ms formula calculations, <500ms API responses

**Current Implementation:**
- ‚ùå Production infrastructure costs $530/month (exceeds budget)
- ‚ùå No auto-scaling configured for 10,000 users
- ‚ùå No performance benchmarking implemented
- ‚ùå No CDN for static assets
- ‚ùå No load balancing architecture

**Impact:** Cannot meet scalability requirements within budget constraints

### 2. Missing Core Application Components üî¥

**PRD Requirements:**
- FR1: Visual drag-and-drop formula builder
- FR2: 20+ AFL metrics library
- FR5: Generate predictions for upcoming rounds
- FR6: Backtest formulas against 2 seasons

**Current Implementation:**
- ‚ùå No formula builder UI implemented
- ‚ùå No metrics library
- ‚ùå No prediction engine
- ‚ùå No backtesting capability
- ‚ùå No data pipeline for AFL data

**Impact:** Zero functional features delivered despite infrastructure deployment

### 3. Data Pipeline Not Started üî¥

**PRD Requirements:**
- FR9: Squiggle API integration
- FR10: AFL Tables scraping
- NFR14: Redis caching with TTL

**Current Implementation:**
- ‚ùå No API integrations
- ‚ùå No data scraping infrastructure
- ‚ùå Redis deployed but not utilized
- ‚ùå No data transformation layer
- ‚ùå No data models defined

**Impact:** Cannot generate predictions without data

### 4. Security & Compliance Gaps ‚ö†Ô∏è

**PRD Requirements:**
- NFR10: HTTPS/TLS 1.3
- NFR11: API rate limiting
- NFR12: JWT authentication
- NFR16: GDPR compliance

**Current Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ HTTPS enabled (Azure default)
- ‚ùå No rate limiting implemented
- ‚ùå No authentication system
- ‚ùå No GDPR compliance features
- ‚ùå No security headers configured
- ‚ùå No input sanitization

**Impact:** Vulnerable to attacks and non-compliant

### 5. Testing Strategy Not Implemented üî¥

**PRD Requirements:**
- 95% coverage for formula engine
- 90% coverage for API endpoints
- Performance benchmarks must pass

**Current Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ Test infrastructure created (Vitest)
- ‚ùå Only placeholder tests exist
- ‚ùå No performance tests
- ‚ùå No integration tests
- ‚ùå No E2E tests
- ‚ùå No load testing

**Impact:** No quality assurance, high risk of bugs

### 6. Monitoring & Observability Missing ‚ö†Ô∏è

**PRD Requirements:**
- Application metrics tracking
- Data pipeline health checks
- Business metrics dashboard
- Real-time alerting

**Current Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ Application Insights deployed
- ‚ùå No custom metrics
- ‚ùå No dashboards configured
- ‚ùå No alerting rules active
- ‚ùå No business KPI tracking

**Impact:** Flying blind, cannot detect issues

### 7. Development Workflow Issues üî¥

**Issues Encountered:**
- Branching strategy too simplistic
- CI/CD hanging for hours (missing variables)
- Terraform state conflicts
- Resource naming inconsistencies
- No environment isolation

**Root Causes:**
- Rushed implementation without planning
- No infrastructure testing before deployment
- Missing documentation on requirements
- No staging environment for testing

## Technical Debt Already Accumulated

1. **Terraform Code Quality:**
   - Hardcoded values instead of variables
   - Missing error handling
   - No module structure
   - Incomplete import statements

2. **CI/CD Pipeline:**
   - Missing variable validation
   - No rollback strategy
   - No blue-green deployment
   - No smoke tests for actual features

3. **Code Structure:**
   - Empty frontend/backend applications
   - No shared types defined
   - No API contracts
   - No error handling patterns

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Current State | Impact | Likelihood |
|------|--------------|--------|------------|
| Budget Overrun | Already at $530/month | Critical | Happened |
| Cannot Scale | No auto-scaling | High | Certain |
| Data Breach | No security measures | Critical | Medium |
| Launch Failure | No features built | Critical | High |
| Technical Debt | Already accumulating | High | Happening |

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why did we fail?

1. **Started with Infrastructure First**
   - Built the house before designing it
   - Deployed expensive resources without need
   - No iterative development approach

2. **Ignored Requirements Documentation**
   - PRD exists but wasn't followed
   - No requirements traceability
   - No acceptance criteria defined

3. **No Technical Design Phase**
   - No system design document
   - No API specifications
   - No data model design
   - No performance planning

4. **Poor Development Practices**
   - No local development environment
   - Direct deployment to cloud
   - No staging environment
   - No feature flags

## Recommended Remediation Plan

### Phase 1: Stop & Stabilize (Week 1)
1. ‚úÖ Destroy production infrastructure (save $530/month)
2. ‚úÖ Create proper branching strategy
3. Create technical design document
4. Define API contracts
5. Design data models

### Phase 2: Local Development First (Week 2-3)
1. Build formula engine locally
2. Create drag-and-drop UI prototype
3. Implement data pipeline with mock data
4. Write comprehensive tests
5. Performance benchmarking

### Phase 3: Incremental Cloud Deployment (Week 4-5)
1. Deploy to dev environment only ($44/month)
2. Use free tiers where possible
3. Implement monitoring before features
4. Load test with realistic data
5. Security audit

### Phase 4: Feature Development (Week 6-10)
1. Implement core formula builder
2. Integrate real data sources
3. Build prediction engine
4. Add backtesting capability
5. User authentication

### Phase 5: Production Readiness (Week 11-12)
1. Performance optimization
2. Security hardening
3. GDPR compliance
4. Documentation
5. Launch preparation

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Technical Design Document Needed
- System architecture diagram
- Component specifications
- API design (OpenAPI)
- Database schema
- Performance model

### 2. Development Environment Setup
```yaml
# docker-compose.yml for local development
services:
  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    ports: ["3000:3000"]
  
  backend:
    build: ./backend
    ports: ["3001:3001"]
  
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: aflpredictor
  
  redis:
    image: redis:7
```

### 3. Proper Testing Strategy
```javascript
// Example: Formula engine test
describe('FormulaEngine', () => {
  it('calculates prediction in <100ms', () => {
    const formula = createFormula(metrics);
    const start = Date.now();
    const result = engine.calculate(formula, matchData);
    expect(Date.now() - start).toBeLessThan(100);
  });
});
```

### 4. Cost-Optimized Architecture
```terraform
# Development environment (Free/Cheap)
resource "azurerm_app_service_plan" "dev" {
  sku {
    tier = "Free"  # F1 - $0/month
    size = "F1"
  }
}

# Use containers for data locally
# Only deploy compute to cloud
```

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong:
1. **No Planning Phase** - Jumped straight to implementation
2. **Infrastructure Over-Engineering** - Built for scale before MVP
3. **Ignored Budget Constraints** - Deployed $530/month immediately
4. **No Iterative Approach** - Big bang deployment
5. **Missing Expertise** - Azure/Terraform learning on the fly

### What We Need:
1. **Technical Leadership** - Architecture decisions before coding
2. **Phased Approach** - Build locally, deploy incrementally
3. **Requirements Traceability** - Map every feature to requirements
4. **Cost Management** - Budget tracking from day 1
5. **Testing First** - TDD approach for critical components

## Conclusion

The project has fundamental issues that stem from starting implementation without proper planning. The good news is we've identified these early (10% into timeline) and can course-correct.

**Recommendation:** Pause infrastructure work, focus on building the actual application locally first, then deploy only what's needed when it's needed.

## Next Steps Checklist

- [ ] Decide on remediation approach
- [ ] Create technical design document
- [ ] Set up local development environment

*This analysis reveals we've built infrastructure for a product that doesn't exist yet. The 10+ deployment attempts and branching issues were warning signs of deeper problems. Let's reset and build properly from the ground up.*
